    "First lets take a brief overview of our Machine Learning (ML) problem. In this scenario we explore a play on a well known disaster, The Titanic, in which a \"ground truth\" for each passenger is determined. Our goal is less gruesome, as instead of life and death on the spaceship tianic we will determine whether almost 13,000 passengers on board will be transported to three habitable exoplanets orbiting nearby stars. Unfortunately while rounding our first destination, the Spaceship Titanic collided with a spacetime anomaly. While the ship stayed intact, almost half of the passengers were transported to an alternate dimension!  "
