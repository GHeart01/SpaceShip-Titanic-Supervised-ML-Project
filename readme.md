### SpaceShip Titanic Supervised Machine Learning Project: CSCA 5622 ###
For my Final project I am going to execute a supervised learning analysis on a kaggle data set https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/data <br>
Here I am using the "Spaceship Titanic" data from an ongoing Kaggle competition where we will predict which passengers are transported to an alternate dimension.
This project includes 3 deliverables: 
* This Juypter notebook - including: problem Decription, EDA procedure, analysis(model building and training), result, and discussion/conclusion
* A video presentation available on Youtube - Explaining what problem we solved, my ML approach and method, and Final Result
    * link here
* and a public github repository - https://github.com/GHeart01/SpaceShip-Titanic-Supervised-ML-Project

#### Problem Description
First lets take a brief overview of our Machine Learning (ML) problem. In this scenario we explore a play on a well known disaster, The Titanic, in which a "ground truth" for each passenger is determined. Our goal is less gruesome, as instead of life and death on the spaceship tianic we will determine whether almost 13,000 passengers on board will be transported to three habitable exoplanets orbiting nearby stars. Unfortunately while rounding our first destination, the Spaceship Titanic collided with a spacetime anomaly. While the ship stayed intact, almost half of the passengers were transported to an alternate dimension!
